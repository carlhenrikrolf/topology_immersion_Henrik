12 ECTS Lab Immersion
=====================

In the end there will be:

1) A written report of 25 to 30 pages.
Details will come later (next week?)

2) An oral presentation around 30 min.

Minor issues
------------

The ripser_to_dict cannot handle a dimension where no entries can be found. The temporary solution has been not to look at those dimensions.

I need some method to optimize the cut-off-values, if theyâ€™re set too low.
